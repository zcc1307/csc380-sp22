## CSC 380: Principles of Data Science (Spring 2023)

This course introduces students to principles of data science that are necessary for computer scientists 
to make effective decisions in their professional careers. A number of computer science sub-disciplines 
now rely on data collection and analysis. For example, computer systems are now complicated enough that
comparing the execution performance of two different programs becomes a statistical estimation problem 
rather than a deterministic computation. This course teaches students the basic principles of how to 
properly collect and process data sources in order to derive appropriate conclusions from them. 
The course has three main components: data analysis, machine learning, and a project where students 
apply the concepts discussed in class to a substantial open-ended problem.

### Logistics info

Time and venue: TuTh 2-3:15pm, M. Pacheco ILC 130

[Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/480747) Entry code: BBRJBW (NB: Please make sure your gradescope email address is the same as the one you have on D2L.)

[D2L course webpage](https://d2l.arizona.edu/d2l/home/1258971): lecture video recordings will be at "UA Tools" -> "Zoom" (NB: Zoom links are for **recordings only** and are not for live-streaming lectures.)


We will be using Piazza to make important announcements and do Q&As. Some general rules:

* If you have technical questions, try posing your questions as general as possible, to promote discussions among the class.
* If you have private questions, generally please make a private Piazza post instead of sending an email - 
  This will help facilitate our processings of your requests significantly.
